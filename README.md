Updated version of my old maze solver: https://github.com/greshbasic/maze-machine

Differences:

    This version is...
  
    - Written in python instead of Java
    
    - Written by scratch opposed to having some files supplied
    
    - Includes 3 search algorithms (DFS, BFS, and GBFS) opposed to just 1 (BFS)
    
    - Includes the ability to save results and compare to other mazes
    
    - Cleaner UI


To get started just cd into the repo `../advanced-maze-machine` and run `python main.py`

Enjoy!
